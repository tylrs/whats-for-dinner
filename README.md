## Technologies Used

The project itself is built with the use of CSS, HTML, and Javascript. I completed the project using Mac's native terminal and Atom text editor. I used github to track our changes and merge branches as I worked through each iteration.

## Overview

Sometimes deciding what you will have for dinner is as difficult as choosing a movie on Netflix. Why waste time? Have a computer do it for you.

## Instructions for Running and Viewing Our Project

Upon launching my page, you will see a form with 3 options of meal types to select from. Choose one, click the "Let's Cook" button and you will see a random recipe suggestion from my curated listed of best recipes ever. If you decide you don't like my recipe suggestion, you can click the "Let's Cook" button again and get a new recipe suggestion. Be warned though, you can't be too picky. As my list of recipes is not infinite, you will eventually run out of recipes to choose from. If this happens, my brilliant JavaScript code will alert you before you start to see repeated recipes again.

Navigation for the site is at the top of the page, allowing users to click to generate a new random cover, save those covers if you like them, view those previously saved covers and even make your own! Each button is tied to event listeners making the page interactive. Buttons are as listed:
* Show New Random Cover
* Save Cover
* View Saved Covers
* Make Your Own Cover

In the View Saved Covers section, users can double click any previously saved covers to delete them if they don't like them....perhaps the romance has fizzled?
In the Make Your Own Cover section, users can use a form to generate any novel with their own source image, title and tagline....make up your own love life!
