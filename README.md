## Technologies Used

The project itself is built with the use of CSS, HTML, and Javascript. I completed the project using Mac's native terminal and Atom text editor. I used github to track my changes and merge branches as I worked through each iteration.

## Overview

Sometimes deciding what you will have for dinner is as difficult as choosing a movie on Netflix. Why waste time? Have a computer do it for you.

## Instructions for Running and Viewing My Project

Upon launching my page, you will see a form with 3 options of meal types to select from. Choose one, click the "Let's Cook" button and you will see a random recipe suggestion from my curated listed of best recipes ever. If you decide you don't like my recipe suggestion, you can click the "Let's Cook" button again and get a new recipe suggestion. Be warned though, you can't be too picky. As my list of recipes is not infinite, you will eventually run out of recipes to choose from. If this happens, my brilliant JavaScript code will alert you before you start to see repeated recipes again.
